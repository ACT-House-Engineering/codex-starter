      <h1>Tulsa Web Devs Meetup</h1>
      <p>Tulsa Web Devs meetups bring together technologists from across a wide range of languages and disciplines. From back-end development to front-end technologies and web-adjacent fields like data science and civic tech&mdash;we aim to learn, share, build, and grow together.</p>
      <h2>This Month&rsquo;s Topic</h2>
      <p><strong>Agent Coding Crash Course: Managing your AI Team Part 2</strong></p>
      <p>Transform your coding process with an AI coworker in three key ideas: clear collaboration guidelines, smart interaction modes, and embedding continuous learning into your code.</p>

        <li><strong>Clear Guidelines:</strong> Set up user and project rules to make AI interactions effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Choosing Interaction Modes:</strong> Understand when to use chat auto-run vs. manual model selection.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedding AI Behavior:</strong> Integrate linting rules, comments, READMEs, tests, and assertions right into your code.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> Document new insights continuously, turning your code into a long-term memory for smarter development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This event is perfect for developers of all experience levels&mdash;whether you want to dig into code, ask questions, or just listen in.</p>
