    <h1>Tulsa Web Devs Meetup</h1>
    <p>Tulsa Web Devs meetups are intended to bring together technologists from across a wide range of languages and disciplines. From back-end development in various languages to front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to web-adjacent fields like data science and civic tech—we aim to learn, share, build, and grow together.</p>
    <h2>Agent Coding Crash Course: Managing your AI Team Part 2</h2>
    <p>Transform your coding process with an AI coworker in three key ideas: clear collaboration guidelines, smart interaction modes, and embedding continuous learning into your code.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear Guidelines: Set up user and project rules to make AI interactions effective.</li>
      <li>Choosing Interaction Modes: Understand when to use chat auto-run vs. manual model selection.</li>
      <li>Embedding AI Behavior: Integrate linting rules, comprehensive comments, READMEs, tests, and runtime assertions right into your code.</li>
      <li>Iterative Improvement: Document new insights continuously, turning your code into a long-term memory for smarter, future-focused development.</li>
